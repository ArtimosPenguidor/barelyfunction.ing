# Welcome to barelyfunction.ing!

I've been programming since the late 00's, and have dabbled in a little bit of everything I could get my hands on. Be it web development, game development, "Hacking", prank viruses, IoT devices, ML, fluid simulations, I've always been interested in learning new things.

I wouldn't consider myself the best or most disciplined programmer, but I have managed to make a successful career out of it.

This website is just a collection of most of the random projects I've worked on in the past, and a few I'm currently working on. To call this a portfolio would be a bit of a stretch, but it's definitely a showcase of all the things I've been interested in over the years.
